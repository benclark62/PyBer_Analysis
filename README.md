### Overview
As a Data Analyst for PyBer, a Python-based ride sharing app company, I have been tasked with completing exploratory analysis on a large set of ride sharing data collected in early 2019.  This analysis will be presented to the company's CEO, V. Isualize, and will inform decisions about improving access to underserved neighborhoods.  I will develop numerous visualizations to better articulate key points of my analysis.

### Results: 
#### More Drivers and Rides Results in Lower, More Consistent Fares 
Comparing the key inputs - drivers, rides, and fares by city type - shows that a larger number of drivers and rides correlates with lower, more consistent fares.  Visualizing the summary data in a bubble chart shows that fares Urban city types are more clustered around lower average fares (average fare = $24.53, Standard Deviation = $11.73) than in Rural city types (average fare = $34.62, Standard Deviation = $14.56).  Driver counts in Urban areas are significantly higher than in Rural areas - 1,625 compared to only 125 - which is illustrated by the bubble sizes and is a contributing factor to the lower average fares.

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

###Summary:
- Grow driver count in rural areas - increasing supply of drivers appears to push fares down
- Need to conduct further analysis on avergae trip distance / time

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
